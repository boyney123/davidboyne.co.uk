        <h2>Mentoring :  1-2-1 Sessions</h2>

        <p>For a limited period of time I would like to help and mentor people.</p>

        <h4>Why?</h4>

        <p>I’m continuously trying to learn and grow, and over the last year have found ways which help me and I thought I would share them.</p>

        <p>In the past I have done this via presentations and blogs, but I want to try a new form which will be 1-2-1 sessions.</p>

        <p>The 1-2-1 session can be over email, Skype messenger or Skype video. I don’t intend these sessions to be very long, but if you have any questions or issues I would like to try and help.</p>

        <h4>What type of people am I looking for?</h4>

        <p>Have you ever had these thoughts?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Im not sure where my career path is going?</li>
            <li>I’ve hit a road block with self learning and development</li>
            <li>How do I promote myself, personally and on the market.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you have, then I would like to help.</strong></p>

        <p>I can share with you some things I have learnt over the last year, and hopefully help you.</p>

        <p>I’m <strong>no expert</strong> in this area but I just genuinely get a lot of personal growth helping others. There might be some things I cannot help with, but there may be some things I can.</p>

        <p>If this sounds interesting just fill in the form below and I will try and get back to you.</p>
