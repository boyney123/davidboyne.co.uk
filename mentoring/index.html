        <h2>Mentoring :  1-2-1 Sessions</h2>

        <p>For a limited period of time I would like to spend some time helping, coaching and mentoring people.</p>

        <h4>Why?</h4>

        <p>I’m continuously trying to learn and grow, and over the last year have found ways in which help me grow and I thought I would like to share them.</p>

        <p>In the past I have done this via Presentations and blogs, but I want to try a new form of helping, which will be 1-2-1 sessions.</p>

        <p>The 1-2-1 session can be over email, Skype messenger or Skype video. I don’t intend these sessions to be very long, but if you have any questions or issues I would like to try and help.</p>

        <h4>What type of people am I looking for?</h4>

        <p>Have you ever had these thoughts?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Im not sure where my career path is going?</li>
            <li>I’ve hit a road block with self learning and development</li>
            <li>I’m not sure what to get into next? Is the next technology the best thing?</li>
            <li>How do I promote myself, personally and on the market.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you have, then I would like to help.</strong></p>

        <p>I can share with you some things I have learnt over the last year, and hopefully get you on the path you would like to get too.</p>

        <p>I’m am <strong>no expert</strong> in these fields but I just generally get a lot of personal growth helping others. There might be something’s I cannot help with, but may be something’s I can help and inspire you with.</p>

        <p>If this sounds interesting just fill in the form below and I will try and get back to you.</p>
