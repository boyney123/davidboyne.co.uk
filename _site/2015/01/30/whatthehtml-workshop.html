<p>As a front end developer I’m always keen on learning new front end techniques and technology and the best way I found to do this was to meet new people and discuss it in person. A few weeks ago I created a JavaScript workshop event and this blog post will cover how, why and lessons learnt from the event.</p>

<h4 id="from-the-start">From the start</h4>

<p>I started looking online for events around Peterborough but couldn’t find much happening in the area. I wondered if people would be interested in a web based event in Peterborough so I decided to create one to see what would happen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the first ‘What the HTML?’ speaker event was run with a huge success…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year in 2014 I created a meetup group called ‘What the HTML?’ as part of Agile Peterborough (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/">http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/</a>) and in late 2014 the first ‘What the HTML?’ speaker event was run with a huge success (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/events/94822712/">http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/events/94822712/</a>). The next stage was to see if there was any interest for a frond end workshop in Peterborough where developers could meet and learn/code. After a month of planning the JavaScript workshop material was created and ready to rock.</p>

<h4 id="the-day">The Day</h4>

<p>On Saturday the 26th April 2014 the event started with free breakfast and drinks. Around 30 people attended the event and were ready to code. The day started off with a small ice breaker for 45 minutes that allowed people to get warmed up and start pairing together. The ice breaker consisted of 11 failing Jasmine tests and they had to read the code and fix them. I was surprised with the success of the ice breaker and was excited to get the day started. The day was split into two parts, Knockout.js in the morning (Held by myself – <a href="https://twitter.com/boyney123">@boyney123</a>) and Angular.js in the afternoon (Held by Chris Neave <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_neave">@chris_neave</a>). Each session was split into 4 lessons. Each lesson had a 10 minute lecture/teaching session and 40 minutes of people coding some exercises. The first session in the morning on knockout.js gave people an understanding of the framework and also allowed them to contribute to a retrospective that was held at the end. We discussed at the pros and cons of the framework collectively as a group through a retrospective. After lunch Chris Neave dived straight into the Angular.js sessions. The format of the lessons was similar to the knockout lessons so people already understood what we were trying to achieve. After the Angular session in the afternoon the group had another retrospective to identify the pros and cons of Angular and also the differences between knockout and Angular. The retrospectives were one of the most valuable parts of the day as it gave people the chance to discuss the frameworks collectively as a group. The day ended with a raffle and another quick retrospective on the event itself. People had the chance to tell us what was good and bad about the day and any ideas they had for the next event/workshop. This allowed us to get instant feedback from the workshop and also allowed to quickly see what people would want for the next one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When the JavaScript workshop event was originally proposed to me from Alex Shaw I was nervous and unsure if I wanted to take on the challenge. At the early stages of organising the workshop I come close to cancelling it numerous times as I thought it was too big a challenge and I was unorganised. Alex kept me on track and focused; it ended up being one of the most rewarding things I have done this year. I learnt that no matter how hard or big the challenge seems at the start, if you’re organised and focused I believe anything is achievable and although the workshop doesn’t sound like much of an challenge I was proud with the help and people that come out on a Saturday in their own time to attended the event. I’d like to thank everybody that helped organise and attended the event without them it wouldn’t have happened. I’d also like to thank Chris Neave for organising and leading the Angular session in the afternoon. I started this post talking about how and why ‘What the HTML’ was created. ‘What the HTML’ was designed and created to help bring people interested in web development to events held in Peterborough. Although it is still early days for ‘What the HTML?’ the two events held were a huge success and I learnt that people are thriving for these events and want more of its kind in Peterborough. This is just the start of ‘What the HTML’ and I look forward to see what comes next!
