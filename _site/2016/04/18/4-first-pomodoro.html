            <section>
                <p>I just experienced and completed my first ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro</a> (experiencing my second pomodoro writing this blog post) and I’m going to share with you what I learnt and managed to achieve and hopefully inspire you to try and do the same.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/time.jpg" alt="Alt text" />

<h2 id="what-is-the-pomodoro-technique">What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>

<p>Firstly I guess I should explain what the technique is if you haven’t already heard of it.</p>

<p>The world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro</a> means tomato in Italian, and the idea came Francesco Cirillo
back in the 1980s and start to get traction in the 1990s. The concept is very simple and is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.</p>

<h3 id="the-task">The task</h3>
<p>Get a task that requires you to focus, and allocate yourself 25 minutes of time (this is the pomodoro). With this time turn off all distractions and focus. Start your timer and start doing your task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…by splitting down our tasks, things become a lot more manageable…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once your timer has finished, you should of managed 25 minutes of focus time and then you are rewarded with a 5 minute break. Then you have completed your  pomodoro.</p>

<p>That’s it. Very easy and very simple. By splitting down our tasks, things become a lot more manageable.</p>

<h2 id="what-inspired-me-to-try-the-pomodoro-technique">What inspired me to try the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>

<p>I’m always exploring ways in which I can <strong>grow</strong> and <strong>learn</strong>. I recently bought a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460994933&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=software+skills">‘Soft Skills – The software developers life manual’ by John Z. Sonmez</a>.</p>

<p>I came across one of the chapters called <strong><em>Pomodoro Technique</em></strong>. I Learnt what it was and wanted to give it a try, thinking surely something so simple cant be that <strong>productive</strong>?</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/thinking.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
<span class="photo-credit">flik from flickr</span></p>

<h2 id="what-was-my-task">What was my task?</h2>

<p>There are so many things I want to do and always find it hard to organise myself, something that I always struggle to do.</p>

<p>One thing I have wanted to do for months is sit down and plan my <strong>future</strong>, <strong>goals</strong>, <strong>objectives</strong> and <strong>personal growth</strong>.</p>

<p>So I thought I would try and apply the Pomodoro technique to see if it can help me.</p>

<p>So I sat down with Evernote, and started a 25 minute timer and started my first Pomodoro.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/motivation.jpg" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<h2 id="what-was-achieved-in-my-first-pomodoro">What was achieved in my first Pomodoro</h2>

<p>I was sceptical at first, how much can this technique really give me? how much could I achieve? What I learnt is that I can <strong>achieve a lot in just 25 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>With 25 minutes I managed to <strong>focus</strong>, gain <strong>flow</strong> to <strong>achieve</strong> the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Started a self development plan for this quarter (April/June)</li>
  <li>Started a self development plan for next quarter (July/October)</li>
  <li>Drafts for blog posts (which was part of my personal goals this quarter)</li>
  <li>This weeks tasks (Stuff I want to achieve this week)</li>
  <li>Next weeks tasks (Stuff I want to achieve next week)</li>
  <li>Evernote setup across all devices for future organisation of my self development, objectives and goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>All with <strong>25 minutes of focused time</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…in 25 minutes I managed to do something that had be bothering me for months…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I succesfully managed to get into <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Classic-Achieve/dp/0712657592"><strong>flow</strong></a> and start to define my <strong>future</strong>, <strong>objectives</strong> and my goals technically and personally. In 25 minutes I managed to do something that had be bothering me for months.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whats next?</h2>

<p>Over the next week my plan is to commit and continue to try the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>. I plan to try and complete 6 this week and 8 next week. (I’m already in my 2nd/3rd writing this post).</p>

<p>I’m very <strong>impressed</strong> with the first set of results and hopefully the rest will let me continue to focus and gain my flow easily.</p>

<p>If you have never tried the Pomodoro technique I highly recommend you read up on it and give it ago.</p>

<p><strong>It would be great to see what you think.</strong></p>
