<h2 id="make-boring-work-fun">1. Make boring work fun</h2>

<p><img src="../../../../images/fun.jpg" alt="Alt text" />

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>Look, we have all been there. Given the BAU (business as usual) task, the work that you can’t engage with, you know the boring tasks, minimal reward and no fun.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>

<p>Simple. Make the task <strong>interesting</strong>, <strong>challenging</strong> and <strong>enjoyable</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes we are given tasks that were not really interested in. Maybe its fixing tests, or bug fixing? Personally I get <strong>demotivated</strong> and bored quite fast with certain tasks, but I have learnt recently that I can easily make these tasks <strong>more enjoyable</strong> and <strong>more rewarding</strong>.</p>

<p>Rather than cracking on with the task, maybe we can look at it with a different angle?</p>

<p>Maybe its exploring different test tools you could use? Different patterns you could use to fix your bugs and issues? Could we try to accomplish a high level of test coverage? Can we make the task more interesting by pairing or mobbing together on a task?</p>

<p>When we think about it there are tons of ways in which we can make a task more <strong>enjoyable</strong>, <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>challenging</strong> and it can drive our <strong>motivation</strong> and <strong>passion</strong> into completing the task; making a task that once was boring now enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id="learn-learn-learn-and-dont-stop">2. Learn, learn, learn and don’t stop</h2>

<p><img src="../../../../images/learn.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
<span class="photo-credit">Credit: Shawn Harquail from flickr</span></p>

<h3 id="the-problem-1">The Problem</h3>
<p>The world is moving and you can’t keep up with everything. If you stop learning you get <strong>unskilled</strong>, <strong>demotivated</strong> and <strong>bored</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution-1">The Solution</h3>
<p>Take time out. Read, blog, listen to podcasts, watch tech talks, sign up to newsletters, code, talk at events, host events, etc…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…Figure out your goals, especially your learning goals…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I have learnt is that we all go through a process of peaks and troughs when it comes to learning. Like a roller coaster. Have you ever wondered during your low stage of learning why you are no longer learning anything?</p>

<p>Try looking at <strong>different mediums</strong> of learning. Maybe it’s going for a walk at lunch listening to a pod cast? Maybe its blogging about things your interested in? Maybe it’s exploring and joining you local community and engaging in new ways in which you wouldn’t before.</p>

<p>Its important we <strong>push ourself</strong> out of our <strong>comfort zone</strong> and start exploring <strong>new ways</strong> in which we can <strong>push ourselves and those around us</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="working-on-side-projects">3. Working on side projects</h2>

<p><img src="../../../../images/code.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
<span class="photo-credit">Credit: Dmitry Baranovskiy from flickr</span></p>

<h3 id="the-problem-2">The Problem</h3>
<p>I don’t have time for side projects? I don’t have any ideas for side projects?</p>

<h3 id="the-solution-2">The Solution</h3>
<p>Just start. If you feel you don’t have time, find some and start <strong>investing in yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>Side projects and open source projects are great way to explore and learn new technologies, thoughts and principles. Haven’t got a side project?  <strong>Just make one</strong>.</p>

<p>Get your ideas and thoughts on paper and start building.</p>

<p>Developers are similar to artists, we have a blank canvas its up to us to paint, so just get your hands dirty and paint something. Doesn’t have to be perfect, but if you get your hands dirty, <strong>you will be better today than what you were yesterday</strong>.</p>

<p>Pick up a side project, invest a few hours a week into it and you eventually will see the <strong>rewards</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="community">4. Community</h3>

<p><img src="../../../../images/community.jpg" alt="Alt text" />
<span class="photo-credit">Credit: Juhan Sonin from flickr</span></p>

<p><strong>Building</strong>, <strong>contributing</strong> and <strong>giving something back</strong> to the community is one of the <strong>biggest rewards</strong> and motivation in my opinion. If you get motivation through other people this is a great platform.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Doing something that matters, doing something in a cause larger than ourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explore your local meetup groups, is there anything around that interests you? If not, create something and get like-minded people together talking about stuff that really motivates you.</p>

<p>Hosting events isn’t as scary as it sounds. If you need any advise or help feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>I would love to hear ways you keep motivated.</p>
