I’ve recently just got back from a short journey of comparing [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Angular2](https://angular.io/) for a new project.
 
I spent just over week gathering information online  about the two and created a slide deck comparing them.
 
I can spend time writing it up here, but just thought I would share the slide deck so you can see for yourself.

If you have any questions just [tweet me](https://twitter.com/boyney123), or leave a comment.
 
*FYI – We ended up picking React as its lightweight and the composition based architecture suits the needs of the project.*
