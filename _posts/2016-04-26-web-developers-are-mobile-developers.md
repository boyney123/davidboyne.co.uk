Last year I was fortunate enough to work on a green field project and build a hybrid mobile application using the [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

Following the success of the project I put together a talk for DDDCambridge 2015.

The slides cover, why we went for hybrid and our decisions to use ionic. It covers our continuous delivery / integration approach for delivering the mobile application and the teams thoughts on using Ionic for mobile development.
