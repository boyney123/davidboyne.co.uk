> Question the requirement. Keep it simple

I heard this quote today and its something that sounds very obvious for every developer but I always see the same mistakes happen throughout my career.

On a day to day basis developers are always asked to do something and most the time its not a problem. But at times the cost for a specific requirement outweighs its return value. If this happens I believe the requirement should be questioned.Â I have learnt that if you question these type of requirements that 60% of the time the requirement will be dropped from scope and 40% of the time it will remain in scope but people will be aware of the cost.

If you end up in this situation, try and question its value and I think you will be amazed from the outcome.
