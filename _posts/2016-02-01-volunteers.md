>I’m currently working on a side project that will be free and open source, that hopefully can generate a culture of sharing and learning around your local area.

I’m exploring the idea of creating a place (website) where IT professionals in a local area can share ideas, events and blogs. Maybe its something you have recently used or would like to share? Maybe its something your company is currently exploring? Or maybe its just a short description of your blog with links to your own blog site?

I think it could be great opportunity for people to promote themselves locally but also generate a local culture of sharing and learning. 

For my first draft of the project **I’m looking for anybody around Peterborough that can provide me a blog post on anything IT related**. Even if you’re an amateur blogger, this could be the perfect platform for any skilled blogger.

I think it would be great to see what the local community is up to, and generate a sharing and learning culture around Peterborough

If this sounds interesting, or you could spare at least 5 minutes for a chat, get in touch.

I would also appreciate if you share this post, to reach a wider audience. Thanks.
