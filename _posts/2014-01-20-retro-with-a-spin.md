> Retrospectives play a huge part for agile teams...

Retrospectives are great for a team as its the time and place where teams can talk about what has gone right or wrong and also create actions to improve as individuals and as a team. Throughout my career I have been in many retrospectives and seen people host them slightly differently but overall they have the same output. What went well, what didn't go so well and what can be improved on. I have been in retrospectives that run every month and retrospectives that run every week. I personally believe that weekly retrospectives are valuable as people in the team always have context on what has happened and I have found if they are run monthly people tend to lose context on what happened over the month so problems or positive ideas are lost. I recently ran and 'R_etrospective with a spin'_ and will share my thoughts on what I learnt. **Why** I read a blog post last week by _[Avi Etzioni](http://avietzioni.blogspot.co.il/2013/11/my-retrospective-about-my-retrospective.html "Avi Etzioni")_ and was interested with his approach on retrospectives and wondered if and how it would work. I put myself forward to run a retrospective and decided to try it out. **How** I started by writing up all the stories (tasks) the team completed in the previous week and wrote them down onto sticky notes. Once that was complete I stuck them up on the wall and explained to the team the new approach. I asked the team to write down any **good** and **bad** points they experienced on each story and stick them up on the board. After 10 minutes we had lots of talking points for the retrospective. The team went through each story and spoke about its good and bad points. As I understood  Avi Etzioni's approach targeted on the improvements for a story but I also wanted to focus on what went well on the stories to boost team moral and give the team an opportunity to praise each other on the work that was delivered. From the bad points raised for each story I asked the team to think of solutions (actions) to improve the situation so we don't repeat our mistakes.

> Pattern occurred

Overtime a pattern occurred. The negative points repeated themselves throughout different story's and the solution/action was the same. At the end of the retrospective we had clear and consist actions which would hopefully solve most of the issues raised. **What I learnt** Retrospectives are very important for a team and also very effective if they are run differently from time to time. I believe this new approach identified problems that would not of arisen from the normal method of retrospectives. Mixing things up from time to time is healthy and I would definitely recommend and run this approach again. **Summary**

1.  Running the retrospective like this gave team visibility on all the stories that were being worked on during the week
2.  Identified common problems which resulted in similar solutions/actions.
3.  Depending on the team size depends on how fast you can go through each story. Even with large teams I think the value returned is worth it
4.  Team were very positive about the new idea and enjoyed it

I would like to thank _Avi Etzioni_ for the idea and my employer for giving me the opportunity to exercise the idea. If your in an agile team why not give it ago? Read Avi's original post [here ](http://avietzioni.blogspot.co.il/2013/11/my-retrospective-about-my-retrospective.html "here")and try it out.
