If you haven’t heard of JavaScript ES6 or ES7 yet, then you must have been living in a cave over the past year.

New features of JavaScript allow us to do some real awesome things these days. I got so excited about them I pulled together a slide deck and started to teach others. Hopefully it can help you too.
