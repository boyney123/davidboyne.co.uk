> We spent too much time focusing on people and their days rather than focusing on the stories.

Every working day for the last year and a half at work I have attended morning stand-ups. We speak about what we have done yesterday and what we plan to do today. Only recently I realised that this sucks and I will explain why in this blog post.

#### The process

![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5538/10034579444_60a0fdc982_c.jpg) I turn up for work and about 30 minutes later we have our stand up. Everybody gets up and starts talking about what they done yesterday and what they plan to do today (sometimes). At the start this was great, it gave great context for the team into what they are doing in a short fashion. But only now I realise and question how much value this actually gives? We can see what everybody is doing and have an overall picture but we kind of missed the point a few times. Sometimes we would have blocked cards within our process and they would naturally sit there for a few days without (hardly) any question. We spent too much time focusing on people and their days rather than focusing on the stories. People would talk about what they done yesterday and often fall into technical discussions that (sometimes) were forced to be taken offline (I have done this many of times…) After we went around the whole team (15/25 minutes later) we would sign up to today’s stories. This was fine and we got to rotate and carry on with the job.

> ...the process slowly was turning into something that felt unnatural

But what I found was the process slowly was turning into something that felt unnatural. We were focusing on what we are currently doing day to day and forgot to talk about the cards themselves. Overtime and with new developers we realised that this was an issue and decided to try something different.

#### What changed?

We stopped focusing on people and focused on the cards on our Kanban wall. Walking through the wall rather than people allowed us to focus on what really matters and what adds value. We start from right to left (rather than left to right) we talk about cards that are ready for deployment first. This doesn’t really take that long as they have already been tested and are ready to be released. Next we talk about our cards currently in test (middle of the board). We see if any testers need any support and we try and see how we can get them moved along into production. Finally we talk about what cards are currently in development. This allows us to focus on what our developers are currently doing and if they need any help or if they are blocked. This process is fast and focused. It allows us to talk about things that matter (the stories) and keeps our discussions focused. I’m not saying we don’t ever talk about anything technical at stand-up but if we need to we hold technical discussions offline (straight after stand-up) if needed.

#### Conclusion

> ...I feel the results we got were interesting and really productive

Our changes to the process didn’t really seem that different on paper but I feel the results we got were interesting and really productive. Our stand-ups time has halved and are more focused. It feels to me that the team are more focused on delivering stories and are moving as one. It’s still early days for the team and the new process, but I will update this blog post after a couple of months with an update on how we get on.
